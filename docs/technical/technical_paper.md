## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Pour-over coffee brewing represents a complex multiphase fluid dynamics problem involving:
- **Water-air interface dynamics** during pouring and percolation
- **Porous media flow** through coffee bed and filter paper
- **Particle-fluid interactions** with coffee grounds
- **Heat and mass transfer** during extraction
- **Surface tension effects** in microchannels

The Hario V60 dripper, with its distinctive spiral ribs and 60° cone angle, creates unique flow patterns that significantly influence extraction efficiency and taste profile. Understanding these phenomena requires sophisticated computational modeling to capture the interplay between:

1. **Macroscopic flow patterns**: Controlled by dripper geometry and pouring technique
2. **Mesoscopic interactions**: Coffee particle suspension and settling
3. **Microscopic physics**: Extraction kinetics and diffusion processes

### 1.2 Scientific Challenges

Traditional CFD approaches face several limitations in coffee brewing simulation:

- **Multiscale nature**: From millimeter-scale dripper geometry to micron-scale pore structure
- **Dynamic interfaces**: Continuously evolving water-air boundaries
- **Complex rheology**: Non-Newtonian behavior of coffee slurry
- **Computational cost**: Real-time simulation requirements for practical applications

### 1.3 Our Contribution

This work introduces the first comprehensive 3D LBM framework specifically designed for pour-over coffee simulation, featuring:

1. **Novel D3Q19 implementation** optimized for coffee brewing physics
2. **Integrated LES turbulence modeling** for high Reynolds number flows
3. **Multi-physics coupling** between flow, particles, and porous media
4. **GPU-accelerated computation** achieving research-grade performance
5. **Industrial-strength numerical stability** with extensive validation

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 Lattice Boltzmann Equation

The fundamental LBM evolution equation governs the distribution functions $f_i(\\mathbf{x}, t)$:

$$
f_i(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{e}_i \\Delta t, t + \\Delta t) - f_i(\\mathbf{x}, t) = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}[f_i(\\mathbf{x}, t) - f_i^{eq}(\\mathbf{x}, t)] + \\Delta t F_i
$$

Where:
- $\\mathbf{e}_i$ are the discrete velocity vectors for D3Q19 model
- $\\tau$ is the relaxation time related to kinematic viscosity
- $f_i^{eq}$ is the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution
- $F_i$ represents external forcing terms

### 2.2 D3Q19 Velocity Set

The D3Q19 model employs 19 discrete velocities optimized for 3D isotropic flows:

$$
\\mathbf{e}_i = \\begin{cases}
(0,0,0) & i = 0 \\\\
(\\pm 1, 0, 0), (0, \\pm 1, 0), (0, 0, \\pm 1) & i = 1-6 \\\\
(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0), (\\pm 1, 0, \\pm 1), (0, \\pm 1, \\pm 1) & i = 7-18
\\end{cases}
$$

With corresponding weights:
$$
w_i = \\begin{cases}
1/3 & i = 0 \\\\
1/18 & i = 1-6 \\\\
1/36 & i = 7-18
\\end{cases}
$$

### 2.3 Macroscopic Variable Recovery

Density and momentum are computed as moments of the distribution functions:

$$
\\rho = \\sum_{i=0}^{18} f_i
$$

$$
\\rho \\mathbf{u} = \\sum_{i=0}^{18} f_i \\mathbf{e}_i
$$

The kinematic viscosity relates to relaxation time via:
$$
\\nu = c_s^2 \\left(\\tau - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\Delta t
$$

Where $c_s = 1/\\sqrt{3}$ is the lattice sound speed.

## 3. Large Eddy Simulation Integration

### 3.1 Smagorinsky Subgrid-Scale Model

For high Reynolds number flows (Re > 1000), we implement the Smagorinsky LES model:

$$
\\nu_{sgs} = (C_s \\Delta)^2 |\\mathbf{S}|
$$

Where:
- $C_s = 0.18$ is the Smagorinsky constant
- $\\Delta$ is the filter width (grid spacing)
- $|\\mathbf{S}| = \\sqrt{2S_{ij}S_{ij}}$ is the strain rate magnitude

### 3.2 Strain Rate Tensor Computation

The strain rate tensor is computed using finite differences:

$$
S_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right)
$$

### 3.3 LES-LBM Coupling

The subgrid viscosity modifies the relaxation time:

$$
\\tau_{eff} = \\frac{\\nu + \\nu_{sgs}}{c_s^2} + \\frac{1}{2}
$$

This approach maintains numerical stability while capturing turbulent energy cascades essential for realistic coffee brewing simulation.

## 4. Multiphase Flow Modeling

### 4.1 Shan-Chen Pseudopotential Model

For water-air interface tracking, we employ the Shan-Chen multiphase model:

$$
\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{fluid}} = -\\psi(\\rho(\\mathbf{x})) \\sum_i w_i \\psi(\\rho(\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{e}_i)) \\mathbf{e}_i
$$

Where $\\psi(\\rho)$ is the pseudopotential function:
$$
\\psi(\\rho) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(p - \\rho c_s^2)}{c_s^2 G}}
$$

### 4.2 Surface Tension Implementation

Surface tension effects are captured through the interparticle force magnitude $G$:

$$
\\sigma = \\frac{G}{6} \\left[\\int \\psi^2(\\rho) d\\rho\\right]^2
$$

For coffee brewing, typical surface tension values range from 0.05-0.07 N/m depending on temperature and dissolved compounds.

## 5. Coffee Particle System

### 5.1 Lagrangian Particle Tracking

Coffee grounds are modeled as discrete particles following Newton's second law:

$$
m_p \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_p}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}_D + \\mathbf{F}_G + \\mathbf{F}_B + \\mathbf{F}_C
$$

Where:
- $\\mathbf{F}_D$ is drag force from fluid interaction
- $\\mathbf{F}_G$ is gravitational force
- $\\mathbf{F}_B$ is buoyancy force
- $\\mathbf{F}_C$ represents particle-particle collisions

### 5.2 Drag Force Modeling

The drag force follows the standard formulation:

$$
\\mathbf{F}_D = \\frac{1}{2} C_D \\rho_f A_p |\\mathbf{u}_f - \\mathbf{v}_p|(\\mathbf{u}_f - \\mathbf{v}_p)
$$

With drag coefficient $C_D$ determined by particle Reynolds number:

$$
Re_p = \\frac{\\rho_f |\\mathbf{u}_f - \\mathbf{v}_p| d_p}{\\mu_f}
$$

### 5.3 Particle-Fluid Coupling

Two-way coupling is achieved through momentum exchange:

$$
\\mathbf{S}_f = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_D}{V_{cell}} \\quad \\text{(fluid momentum source)}
$$

## 6. Boundary Conditions and Geometry

### 6.1 Hario V60 Geometry Implementation

The V60 dripper geometry is characterized by:
- **Cone angle**: 60° for optimal drainage
- **Spiral ribs**: 24 ribs with 25° angle
- **Bottom outlet**: 8mm diameter
- **Internal volume**: ~240ml

Mathematical representation of the cone surface:

$$
r(z) = r_{top} - \\frac{z}{\\tan(30°)} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\leq z \\leq h
$$

### 6.2 Boundary Condition Strategy

We implement a comprehensive boundary condition framework:

1. **Velocity Inlet**: Controlled pouring with realistic flow rates
2. **Pressure Outlet**: Natural drainage at bottom
3. **No-slip Walls**: V60 surface and rib structure
4. **Porous Medium**: Coffee bed with Darcy-Forchheimer model
5. **Free Surface**: Dynamic water-air interface

### 6.3 Porous Media Treatment

Coffee bed permeability follows the Kozeny-Carman equation:

$$
k = \\frac{\\varepsilon^3 d_p^2}{180(1-\\varepsilon)^2}
$$

Where $\\varepsilon$ is porosity and $d_p$ is particle diameter.

        u_local /= rho_local
        
        # Apply LES turbulence model
        if ENABLE_LES:
            nu_sgs = self.compute_sgs_viscosity(i, j, k)
            tau_eff = self.tau + nu_sgs / (CS_SQR)
        else:
            tau_eff = self.tau
        
        # Equilibrium distribution
        for q in range(19):
            feq = self.equilibrium(q, rho_local, u_local)
            self.f_new[q, i, j, k] = self.f[q, i, j, k] - (self.f[q, i, j, k] - feq) / tau_eff
```
